Binary Tree:
  -> A tree is a data structure that has a heirachical structure where there are
  parents and children, unlike normal graphs.
  -> A binary tree is a tree in which each node has at most two children, left
  and right.
  -> There are different ways of traversing a binary tree in a Depth First 
  Search mannerr:
    a.) Preorder: Node, Left, Right
    b.) Inorder: Left, Node, Right
    c.) Postorder: left, right, node

  -> You can traverse trees recursively and iteratively.
  -> You can traverse a tree with BFS (Breadth First Search), useful for 'level
  order traversal'.
