Linked Lists:
  -> Learn to reverse a Linked List!
  -> A Linked List is a chain of Nodes. A Node is composed of a Value and a
  Pointer to the next Node (usually called next)
  -> Use a dummy node when you are not sure what the Head of the LinkedList will
  be.
  -> Most of the time, you will have to use multiple pointers to solve these
  questions.
  -> Useful trick: To detect cycle, have one pointer move twice as fast as the
  other pointer.
  -> Doubly Linked Lists are Linked Lists that have two pointers, one pointing
  to the next node and one pointing to its previous node.
